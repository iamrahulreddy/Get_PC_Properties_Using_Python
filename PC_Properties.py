	"""Virtual Memory is a storage mechanism which offers user an illusion of having a very big main memory. 
	   It is done by treating a part of secondary memory as the main memory. 
	   In Virtual memory, the user can store processes with a bigger size than the available main memory.
       Therefore, instead of loading one long process in the main memory, the OS loads the various parts of more than one process in the main memory. 
       Virtual memory is mostly implemented with demand paging and demand segmentation.

       Virtual Memory is a memory management technique that is implemented using both hardware and software. 
	   It is also a feature of an Operating System (OS) that allows a computer to compensate for shortages of physical memory by temporarily transferring pages of data from Random Access Memory (RAM) to Hard disk storage.
	   The process is known as Paging or Swapping and the temporary storage space on the hard disk is called a Page file or a swap file.
